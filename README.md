# SimplifyFFMPEG
A GUI for FFMPEG that makes converting multiple files a bit easier

Typically, you will just change the extension in the parameter text box to the extension you would like to convert to.

For example, if you would like to convert a folder full of `.webm` files to `.mp3` you would change this extension:

`{FileName}.m4a` to `{FileName}.mp3` and then drag/drop the files onto SimplifyFFMPEG.
